             <li><strong>Open Photoshop:</strong> Launch Adobe Photoshop on your computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Images:</strong> Open the image of the object that you want in my case it's an image of a cat,
                     you can also open your second image i chose an image of the ocean as my background in Photoshop.
                    you can open the file by Going  to File > Open, navigate to the location of your images, select them, and click Open.
                You can also simply drag the image into photoshop </li>
                <li><strong>Select the Cat Image:</strong> In the Layers panel, you should see both images listed as separate layers.
                     Click on the layer containing the cat image to select it.</li>
                <li><strong>Copy the Cat Image:</strong>  With the cat layer selected, press Ctrl + A (Command + A on Mac) to select the entire image. Then, press Ctrl + C (Command + C on Mac) to copy the image.</li>
                <li><strong>Select the Ocean Background Image:</strong> Click on the ocean background layer in the Layers panel to select it.</li>
                <li><strong>Paste the Cat Image:</strong> Press Ctrl + V (Command + V on Mac) to paste the cat image onto the ocean background. The cat image will appear as a new layer above the ocean background layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Position and Resize the Cat Image:</strong> Click and drag the cat image to position it where you want it within the ocean background. You can also resize the cat image if necessary by selecting Edit >
                     Free Transform (or press Ctrl + T / Command + T) and then dragging the handles on the corners or sides of the bounding box.</li>
                <li><strong>Blend the Cat Image:</strong> To make the cat blend more seamlessly into the ocean background, you may need to adjust its brightness, contrast, color balance, and other attributes.
                    You can use adjustment layers such as Levels, Curves, Hue/Saturation, and Color Balance to achieve this. Experiment with different adjustments until you're satisfied with the result.</li>
                <li><strong>Refine Edges (Optional):</strong> If the edges of the cat image appear too sharp or unnatural, you can use the Refine Edge tool to soften them.
                    With the cat layer selected, go to Select > Select and Mask, then use the Refine Edge Brush to refine the edges as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Touches: </strong>Once you're happy with the positioning and blending of the cat image, you can make any final adjustments to the overall composition,
                     such as adding shadows or highlights to create depth and realism.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Your Work: </strong>When you're finished, save your Photoshop document to preserve your work. Go to File >
                     Save As, choose a file format (e.g., PSD for Photoshop files, or JPEG for a compressed image), and click Save.</li>
