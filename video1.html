        <div id="video-description" class="description">
          <li>  In this tutarial you will learn how to blur the background of and leave just the motive you want in focus, first let's start off by 
            opening the image in photoshop. You can do this by draging the image to photoshop or by going to file and selecting the file you want.</li>

            <li><strong>Select the Quick Selection Tool: </strong>Select the Quick Selection Tool from the toolbar on the left side of the screen.
                 It looks like a brush with a dotted circle around the tip (you can also press `W` on your keyboard to select it).</li>
            <li><strong>Select Your Subject:</strong>In my case it's the cow at the very front. 
                Click and drag the Quick Selection Tool over the motive you want to keep sharp.
                The tool will automatically try to detect edges and create a selection around the cows. 
                Or you can go above the application where it says <strong>Select Subject</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Refine Your Selection:</strong>
               If the selection includes parts you don't want, hold down the `Alt` key (Windows) or `Option` key (Mac) and click on the areas to deselect them.
               If you missed parts of the cows you want to include, continue clicking and dragging to add to your selection.</li>
               
             <li><strong>Invert the Selection:</strong> Once you have selected the cows you want to keep sharp, 
                invert the selection so that the background and the cows you want to blur are selected. To do this,
                 go to `Select > Inverse` or press `Shift + Ctrl + I` (Windows) / `Shift + Command + I` (Mac), 
                 or you can simpley right click on your mouse.</li>

            <li><strong>Apply Blur to the Background:</strong>
               - With the background and unwanted cows selected, go to `Filter > Blur > lens Blur`.
               - In the lens Blur dialog box or the bur option you selected , adjust the `Radius` slider to achieve the desired level of blur.
                You can preview the effect in the image. Click `OK` when you're satisfied with the blur effect.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Deselect the Selection:</strong>
               - To remove the selection outline, go to `Select > Deselect` or press `Ctrl + D` (Windows) / `Command + D` (Mac). </li>
            
            <li><strong>Save Your Image:</strong>
               - Save your edited image by going to `File > Save As` and choose the desired format and location.
               <br>
               <br>
        That's it! You've successfully blurred the background while keeping the main subject in focus. </li>
